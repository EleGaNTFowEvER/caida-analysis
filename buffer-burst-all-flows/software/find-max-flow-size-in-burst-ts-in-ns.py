Clarification:

Data used by Sourav is in the format:

The meaning of each part follow:
packetId, srcIp, desIp, srcPort, desPort, length, relative time

Method Improvement:

In the program, we used much more accurate time data for analysis.
The code works for packets whose timestamps are in ns. We have a good degree
of confidence to say that there is no overlap between the packets (which is
theoritically true), but we notice the same thing given the inaccuracies inherent
in the timestamping process.

We chose a delta of 10ns, since  64B packet over a 10 Gbps link has a transmission
time of 51 ns. So we keep a gap of 10ns which is 20% of the minimum packet
transmission time.
